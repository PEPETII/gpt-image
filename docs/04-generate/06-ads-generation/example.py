Make it feel like a polished campaign image for a youth streetwear audience: stylish, contemporary, energetic, and tasteful.
Use clean composition, strong color direction, natural poses, and premium fashion photography cues.
Render the tagline exactly once, clearly and legibly, integrated into the ad layout.
No extra text, no watermarks, no unrelated logos.
