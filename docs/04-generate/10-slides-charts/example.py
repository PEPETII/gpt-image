Create one pitch-deck slide titled **"Market Opportunity"** that feels like a real Series A fundraising slide from a YC-backed startup.

Use a clean white background, modern sans-serif typography like Inter, and a crisp, minimal layout. The slide should include:

* A TAM/SAM/SOM concentric-circle diagram in muted blues and grays
* Specific, believable market sizing numbers:

  * **TAM:** $42B
  * **SAM:** $8.7B
  * **SOM:** $340M
* A clean bar chart below showing market growth from **2021 to 2026**, with a subtle upward trend
* Small footnotes: **"AGI Research, 2024"** and **"Internal analysis"**
* A company logo placeholder in the bottom-right corner

The design should look like it belongs in a deck that actually raised money: highly readable text, clear data hierarchy, polished spacing, and professional startup-style visual language.

Avoid clip art, stock photography, gradients, shadows, decorative elements, or anything that feels generic or overdesigned.
